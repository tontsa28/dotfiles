## Windows Terminal
- Windows Terminal can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) or by searching "Windows Terminal" from the Microsoft Store.
- Windows Terminal source code is available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).
 ### PLEASE NOTE:
 - The configuration needs to be pasted to the following path:
 ``C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState``.
 - To use the exact same configuration, you need [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) with Ubuntu and Kali installed (they are included in the config, should work fine without them as well).
