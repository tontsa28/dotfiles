# dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repository. This repo holds the configuration files of my Linux system(s). These dotfiles should work on various operating systems, including most of the Linux distributions and the various BSD systems (this has not been tested). Some of these dot files might even work on MacOS (also not tested), such as the Alacritty configuration.
